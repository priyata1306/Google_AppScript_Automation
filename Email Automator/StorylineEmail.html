    <p> Dear <?= fn ?>, </p>
    
    <p> Here is your license key for Storyline 3:   <?= key ?> </p>
    
    <p><b> This serial number is unique to yourself and should not be shared with anyone else. </b><p>
    
    <p> See our Spark site for support and guidance on how to install and get started with the tool. <br>

    <p> What happens to your Storyline 2 courses? <br>
        Storyline 2 courses are compatible in Storyline 3. 
        When you open an older course in Storyline 3, it will create a new version of the course, so the Storyline 2 version will not be affected. </p>
        
    <p> To minimise any risk during your course development, we recommend that you complete any courses you currently have in production in Storyline 2, 
        and then start brand new projects in Storyline 3. <br>
