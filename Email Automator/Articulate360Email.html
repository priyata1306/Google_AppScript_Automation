    <p> Dear <?= fn ?>, </p>
    
    <p> PwC Global Digital Learning has invited you to join a team account on Articulate 360. 
        Before you start building in the tool, we recommend that you visit the following 360 Spark site that provides training, 
        support and guidance on how to get the most out of this tool. <br>
        
     <a href = "https://pwc-spark.com/groups/learning-technology-development-community/projects/articulate-360-suite/pages/home">https://pwc-spark.com/groups/learning-technology-development-community/projects/articulate-360-suite/pages/home </a></p>
     
     <p><b> Please note the Articulate can only be used for L&D purposes and cannot be used for external client work. </b></p>
     
     <p> Security is very important at PwC and becomes even more important when using online tools, such as GoMo. 
    To reduce the risk of your accounts being hacked, you must create complex passwords that are at least eight characters long and contain alphabets and numbers. 
    In addition, you must also change your password every 3 months. 
    GoMo will not automatically prompt you to do this, so it is important that you do this yourself. </p>
    
    <p> Happy building! <br> Learning Services </p>
