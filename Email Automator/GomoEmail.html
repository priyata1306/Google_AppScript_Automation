    <p> Dear <?= fn ?>, </p>
    
    <p> PwC Global Digital Learning has invited you to join a team account on GoMo. Before you start building on the tool, 
    we recommend that you visit the following GoMo Spark site that provides training, support and guidance on how to get the most out of this tool.
    </p>
    
    <p> <a href = "https://pwc-spark.com/groups/learning-technology-development-community/projects/gomo">https://pwc-spark.com/groups/learning-technology-development-community/projects/gomo </a></p>
    
    <p> Please also take the time to look at the Information Risk Assessment report on Gomo </p>
    
    <p> <a href = "https://pwc-spark.com/docs/DOC-914870"> https://pwc-spark.com/docs/DOC-914870 </a></p>
    
    <p> <b> Please note the GoMo can only be used for L&D purposes and cannot be used for external client work. </b> </p>
    
    <p> Security is very important at PwC and becomes even more important when using online tools, such as GoMo. 
    To reduce the risk of your accounts being hacked, you must create complex passwords that are at least eight characters long and contain alphabets and numbers. 
    In addition, you must also change your password every 3 months. 
    GoMo will not automatically prompt you to do this, so it is important that you do this yourself. </p>
    
    <p> Regards, <br> LMS Support </p>
